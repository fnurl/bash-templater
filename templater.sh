# Very simple templating system that replaces {{VAR}} with the value of $VAR.
# Supports default values by writing {{VAR=value}} inside the template file.
# Read values from a file using the same format; one {{VAR=value}} entry on each
# line.
#
# Any variable that has been set in the current environment will not be
# overwritten. This means that if you supply the value of a variable on the
# command line, this will ignore defaults in the template file, and also ignore
# any values provided by a config file.
#
# If variable values are provided by config file and not present in the
# enviroment, the defaults will also be ignored.

function usage {

    -h   Show this help text
    -p   Don't do anything, just print the result of the variable expansion(s)
    -f   Specify a file to read variables from

Default values in the template file will be ignored if they are provided by the

be ignored if the variable is set in the environment.
